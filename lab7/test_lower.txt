there
are
many
other
unfounded
ideas
current
among
the
rest
of
the
hellenes
even
on
matters
of
contemporary
history
which
have
not
been
obscured
by
time
for
instance
there
is
the
notion
that
the
lacedaemonian
kings
have
two
votes
each
the
fact
being
that
they
have
only
one
and
that
there
is
a
company
of
pitane
there
being
simply
no
such
thing
so
little
pains
do
the
vulgar
take
in
the
investigation
of
truth
accepting
readily
the
first
story
that
comes
to
hand
on
the
whole
however
the
conclusions
i
have
drawn
from
the
proofs
quoted
may
i
believe
safely
be
relied
on
assuredly
they
will
not
be
disturbed
either
by
the
lays
of
a
poet
displaying
the
exaggeration
of
his
craft
or
by
the
compositions
of
the
chroniclers
that
are
attractive
at
truth
s
expense
the
subjects
they
treat
of
being
out
of
the
reach
of
evidence
and
time
having
robbed
most
of
them
of
historical
value
by
enthroning
them
in
the
region
of
legend
turning
from
these
we
can
rest
satisfied
with
having
proceeded
upon
the
clearest
data
and
having
arrived
at
conclusions
as
exact
as
can
be
expected
in
matters
of
such
antiquity
to
come
to
this
war
despite
the
known
disposition
of
the
actors
in
a
struggle
to
overrate
its
importance
and
when
it
is
over
to
return
to
their
admiration
of
earlier
events
yet
an
examination
of
the
facts
will
show
that
it
was
much
greater
than
the
wars
which
preceded
it
with
reference
to
the
speeches
in
this
history
some
were
delivered
before
the
war
began
others
while
it
was
going
on
some
i
heard
myself
others
i
got
from
various
quarters
it
was
in
all
cases
difficult
to
carry
them
word
for
word
in
one
s
memory
so
my
habit
has
been
to
make
the
speakers
say
what
was
in
my
opinion
demanded
of
them
by
the
various
occasions
of
course
adhering
as
closely
as
possible
to
the
general
sense
of
what
they
really
said
and
with
reference
to
the
narrative
of
events
far
from
permitting
myself
to
derive
it
from
the
first
source
that
came
to
hand
i
did
not
even
trust
my
own
impressions
but
it
rests
partly
on
what
i
saw
myself
partly
on
what
others
saw
for
me
the
accuracy
of
the
report
being
always
tried
by
the
most
severe
and
detailed
tests
possible
my
conclusions
have
cost
me
some
labour
from
the
want
of
coincidence
between
accounts
of
the
same
occurrences
by
different
eye
witnesses
arising
sometimes
from
imperfect
memory
sometimes
from
undue
partiality
for
one
side
or
the
other
the
absence
of
romance
in
my
history
will
i
fear
detract
somewhat
from
its
interest
but
if
it
be
judged
useful
by
those
inquirers
who
desire
an
exact
knowledge
of
the
past
as
an
aid
to
the
interpretation
of
the
future
which
in
the
course
of
human
things
must
resemble
if
it
does
not
reflect
it
i
shall
be
content
in
fine
i
have
written
my
work
not
as
an
essay
which
is
to
win
the
applause
of
the
moment
but
as
a
possession
for
all
time
the
median
war
the
greatest
achievement
of
past
times
yet
found
a
speedy
decision
in
two
actions
by
sea
and
two
by
land
the
peloponnesian
war
was
prolonged
to
an
immense
length
and
long
as
it
was
it
was
short
without
parallel
for
the
misfortunes
that
it
brought
upon
hellas
never
had
so
many
cities
been
taken
and
laid
desolate
here
by
the
barbarians
here
by
the
parties
contending
the
old
inhabitants
being
sometimes
removed
to
make
room
for
others
never
was
there
so
much
banishing
and
blood
shedding
now
on
the
field
of
battle
now
in
the
strife
of
faction
old
stories
of
occurrences
handed
down
by
tradition
but
scantily
confirmed
by
experience
suddenly
ceased
to
be
incredible
there
were
earthquakes
of
unparalleled
extent
and
violence
eclipses
of
the
sun
occurred
with
a
frequency
unrecorded
in
previous
history
there
were
great
droughts
in
sundry
places
and
consequent
famines
and
that
most
calamitous
and
awfully
fatal
visitation
the
plague
all
this
came
upon
them
with
the
late
war
which
was
begun
by
the
athenians
and
peloponnesians
by
the
dissolution
of
the
thirty
years
truce
made
after
the
conquest
of
euboea
to
the
question
why
they
broke
the
treaty
i
answer
by
placing
first
an
account
of
their
grounds
of
complaint
and
points
of
difference
that
no
one
may
ever
have
to
ask
the
immediate
cause
which
plunged
the
hellenes
into
a
war
of
such
magnitude
the
real
cause
i
consider
to
be
the
one
which
was
formally
most
kept
out
of
sight
the
growth
of
the
power
of
athens
and
the
alarm
which
this
inspired
in
lacedaemon
made
war
inevitable
still
it
is
well
to
give
the
grounds
alleged
by
either
side
which
led
to
the
dissolution
of
the
treaty
and
the
breaking
out
of
the
war
